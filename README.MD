#Angular 1.5 Nutrition Tracker

This is a breakable toy for practicing with Angular 1.5. It queries the Nutrionix API, and saves food to a Firebase database. I also used it to experiment with building components using flexbox.

## Setup

Clone the repository and run `npm install`

In `app/services/constants_SAMPLE.js` enter your [Nutrionix](https://www.nutritionix.com/) app id and app key, and your [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) url where indicated. Save the file as `constants.js`.

Run `gulp build`.

I generally use browser-sync as a local server.
